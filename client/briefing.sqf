player createDiaryRecord["rules",
["Important","
<br/>
Be respectful to Admins and they will be the same.<br/>
Remember the Admins are gamers and want to game in the server too.<br/>
If you feel you have a valid reason to appeal a Ban you can get in touch with the Admin team by either registering on our website or stop by on our Public Teamspeak 3 Server.<br/>

<br/>
Please register on our website at dp-clan.enjin.com and join dp Wasteland Community to find out what we are up to and what our future plans for the Servers are. Suggestions for future versions of dp Wasteland are always welcome<br/><br/>
General Game Play:<br/>
- Each player starts with the following in their player menu: 1 food, 1 water, 1 single use Medkit, 1 single use Repair kit and 1 full Jerry Can.<br/>
- Jerry cans can be filled at the gas station, the general stores, green oil barrels found around the island or by syphoning fuel from vehicles.<br/>
- Loot dead bodies for money and players gear. Items are no longer stored in the lame brown sack.<br/>
- To give someone an item you must stand close to them and use the player menu to give the selected item to the select player.<br/>
- The general store sells, food, water, single use Medkits and repair kits and fuel.<br/>
- There are usually 58 ground vehicles, 8 Helis, 12 ammo/weapons crates, 12 survival items (food sacks, water containers) in the game at any one time.<br/>
- Vehicles with mounted guns, wheeled APCs, tracked armour, armed Helis and extra ammo/weapons crates can be obtained by completing the regular in-game objectives.<br/>
- Only the lower powered guns can be found in vehicles. Higher powered guns and launchers can be found in ammo/weapons crates or bought at the Gun stores.<br/>
- Gunstores sell a full range of Weaponry and Ammo.<br/>
- To build a base buy items from the Construction Store make sure to leave space for the objects to spawn in, vehicles and sandbags dont mix well.<br/>
- The Scanner will detect the enemy and display their coloured tag above their head. This is only a 5% chance for a second. The scanner will also display team mates tags if the Admin has disabled them for a hardcore game.<br/>
"]];

player createDiaryRecord["gameplayhelp",
["Game Play - Hardcore","
<br/>
Hardcore Mode:<br/>
- The dp Wasteland mod allows the Admin to disable player tags and/or disable groups to give a harder more tactical game play (This has had good feedback apart for the odd troll).<br/>
- This is not difficult to understand or get use too, so please give it a go and dont whine.<br/>
- Tags are disabled for everyone, Blufor, Opfor and Independents. Use your scanner to identify players (sometimes the coloured cap are a decoy).<br/>
- Think before shooting, even with tags off excessive team killing can result in a Kick from the server.<br/>
- Try stay in cover and even talk over direct chat and engage with the other player.<br/>
- Remember Independents vs Independents so dont complain if everyone kills you, if groups are disabled they are disabled for everyone.<br/>
